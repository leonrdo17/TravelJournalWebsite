                <h2>Cuisine</h2>
                <h3>Soupe à l'oignon</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. The soup's origins can be traced as far back as the Romans – typically a poor dish – although the current version dates from the 18th century. The remarkable taste in French onion soup is from the caramelisation of the onions, to which sometimes brandy or sherry is added at the end of the slow-cook process. The liquid is typically meat stock, although variations include using just water, adding milk or thickening it with eggs or flour. For another popular French soup, try the traditional fishermen’s soupe de poisson à la rouille from Marseille, characterised by a dollap of garlic and saffron mayonnaise (rouille) on top.</p>

                <h3>Coq au vin</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">This quintessential French food was popularised by Julia Child through her television show and book and seen as one of her signature dishes. It is a dish of chicken braised (pot roasted) with wine, mushrooms, salt pork or bacon (lardons), mushrooms, onion, often garlic and sometimes brandy. Although the name translates as 'rooster or cock in wine' – and braising is ideal for tougher birds – the recipe usually uses chicken or capon. A red Burgundy wine is typically used, although French regional variations exist using local wines, for example coq au vin jaune (Jura), coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet (Beaujolais nouveau) and coq au Champagne (Champagne).</p>
                <h3>Cassoulet</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Cassoulet is a comfort dish of white beans stewed slowly with meats, typically pork or duck but also sausages, goose, mutton or whatever else the chef has around. This peasant dish originates from southern France and is popular in Toulouse, Carcassonne and Castelnaudary. The name of the dish comes from the pot (cassole) it's traditionally baked in, which is typically shaped like an inverted cone to give the greatest amount of tasty crust. This is a rich, hearty meal perfect for colder months.</p>
                <h3>Beef bourguignon</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Boeuf bourguignon is a traditional French meal that has become internationally well-known. Coming from the same region as coq au vin –Burgundy (or in French, Bourgogne) in east France – beef bourguignon has several similarities. The dish is a stew made of beef braised in red wine, beef broth and seasoned with garlic, pearl onions, fresh herbs and mushrooms. This recipe is just one example of how traditional peasant dishes have been adopted into haute cuisine; the method of slowly simmering beef in wine was likely developed to tenderise tough (or cheap) cuts of meat. Traditional preparation time is two days to tenderise the meat and intensify the stew flavours. In Burgundy in late August, the Fête du Charolais celebrates the prized Charolais beef with music, meat and bœuf bourguignon.</p>

                <!-- START OF SOCIAL CONVENTION -->
                <h2>Social Convention</h2>
                <h3>Dress</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Although the French are often formal in their relationships, their dress habits, even in the office, are often extremely casual. Note, however, that the French tend to judge people by their dress, the style and quality being as important as the correctness for the occasion (people often wear ‘designer’ jeans to dinner). You aren’t usually expected to dress for dinner, depending of course on the sort of circles you move in. On invitations, formal dress (black tie) is smoking exigé/tenue de soirée and informal dress is tenue de ville.</p>
                <h3>Greetings</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Do say hello (“Bonjour”) upon entering an establishment (ie. store, restaurant, etc) before you begin browsing or asking questions. Say good-bye (“Au revoir”) upon leaving. Do learn some French phrases. It will show you are making the effort to speak the language and shows respect. Some phrases :<br/>
                1. Hello (“Bonjour”)<br/>
                2. Thank you (“Merci”)<br/>
                3. Excuse me (“Excusez-moi”)<br/>
                4. Please (“S’il vous plait”)<br/>
                5. I am lost (“Je suis perdu”)<br/>
                6. Etc.</p>
                <h3>Kiss</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">To kiss or not to kiss, that is the question. It’s best to take it slowly when negotiating this social minefield and to take your cue from the French. You shouldn’t kiss ( faire la bise) when first introduced to an adult, although young children will expect to be kissed. If a woman expects you to kiss her, she will offer her cheek. (Note that men kiss women and women kiss women but men don’t kiss men, unless they’re relatives or very close friends.) The ‘kiss’ is deposited high up on the cheek; it isn’t usually a proper kiss, more a delicate brushing of the cheeks accompanied by kissing noises, although some extroverts will plant a great wet smacker on each side of your face. The next question is which cheek to kiss first. Again, take your cue from the natives, as the custom varies from region to region (and even the natives aren’t always sure where to start).</p>
                <h3>Eating &amp; Drinking</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">You shouldn’t serve any drinks (or expect to be served one) before all guests have arrived – even if some are an hour or more late! If you’re offered a drink, wait until your host has toasted everyone’s health ( santé) before taking a drink. Never pour your own drinks (except water) when invited to dinner. If you aren’t offered a(nother) drink, it’s time to go home. Always go easy on the wine and other alcohol; if you drink to excess you’re unlikely to be invited back! The French say bon appétit before starting a meal and you shouldn’t start eating until your hosts do. It’s polite to eat everything that’s put on your plate. Cheese is served before dessert.</p>

                <!-- START OF LANGUAGES -->
                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">French is one of the world’s major languages. It is a main or official language not just in France, but in parts of Belgium and Switzerland, in Monaco, in parts of Canada – notably but not only in Quebec – as well as being widely spoken in north and west Africa, Lebanon, and parts of south-east Asia, particularly in former French colonies. It is an official or a main second language in 55 countries worldwide, and is reputed to be the foreign language which is most widely used in international communications, after English. Almost 300 million people speak French as their native language or as a second language. Until the early twentieth century, French was the language of diplomacy, and one of the two main languages of international negotiation; today it is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and one of the two official languages, with English, of the International Postal Union, of the International Olympic Committee, the International Red Cross, and other organisations. It is also an official language in the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey.</p>
                <!-- END OF LANGUAGES -->

                <!-- START OF RELIGION -->
                <h2>Religions</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">The primary religion in France is Catholicism. More than 80% of the population declares themselves as Catholics, even though the majority of them don’t actually practice religion but just express their traditional religious background. Generally, ever since the French Revolution, France has been a very secular country. However, it is a home to Lourdes, probably the most famous Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Islam has spread a lot over France in the last 50 years because of all the Muslim immigrants from former French colonies in Africa. Today, about 5% of the French population practices Islam. While in 1914 there were only about 4000-5000 Muslims in France, today this number is around 4-6 million, although it is not completely sure how significant religion is for them. Protestantism significantly decreased in number after persecution in the 16th and 17th centuries, so today Protestants are only 2% of the population. There are even less Jews, about 1% of the population, but still this is 1/3 of the entire Jewish population in Europe. Even though their number isn’t large, the Jewish community has always played an important role in France, both in cultural and in a financial sense. Generally, it is difficult to statistically present a certain religion in France because French laws forbid statistics related to religious beliefs.</p>

                <h2>Traditional Arts</h2>
                <h3>Bourrée Dance</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">The bourrée, one of the most popular folk dances of France, comes in many regional varieties. Characteristically, it is done with quick, skipping steps, typically to music played in 2/4 or 6/8 time. Dancers will sometimes even wear wooden clogs to emphasize the rapid movements of their feet through sound. The bourrée is a line dance, with a line of men facing and dancing with a line of women. Some of the greatest composers have written stylized bourrées, including Bach and Handel.</p>

                <h3>Mazurka Dance</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">The mazurka is a seductive dance for couples popular throughout Europe, but the French have put their own stamp on it. It is typically done in 3/3 time to the rhythm of the three-syllable word “mazurka,” with an accent on the second beat. A French mazurka starts with the man taking three steps, starting with his left foot, and the woman mirroring him with her right. They then make a quarter turn to the leader’s left and take three steps on their opposite feet from the first time. (The man starts with his right, the woman with her left.). Finally, they complete the turn they started on the second step. The Polish composer Chopin, who settled in France, wrote many mazurkas for solo piano.</p>

                <h3>French Harp</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Otherwise known as a mouth organ or harmonica the French Harp is played by placing your lips over its holes and blowing air into it or drawing air out of it. The French Harp is played all over the world - although it is known by different names in different countries - but many a frenchman own the very own copy.</p>
