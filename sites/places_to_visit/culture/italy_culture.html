                <h2>Cuisine</h2>
                <h3>Pasta</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Pasta types vary significantly depending where you go in Italy. Be sure to try the regional specialties in the cities that you are visiting. If you are exploring beautiful Rome, order a serving of the pasta alla carbonara, prepared with ingredients such as eggs, Pecorino cheese, guanciale (a type of Italian cured meat made from pork cheeks) and black pepper.</p>

                <h3>Pizza</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">When it comes to pizza, the first type that comes to mind is Margherita. Originating from Naples, the pizza margherita is a simple but tasty dish. Order this popular item from the local pizzeria, and you can expect to be served with a crispy, thin-crust pizza topped with olive oil, garlic, basil, tomatoes, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p>

                <h3>Lasagne</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Believed to have originated from the city of Naples, this well-loved and yet another classic Italian dish is made by baking sheets of lasagne pasta layered with cheese, ground meat, vegetables and different varieties of sauces, such as the ragù, bechamel or tomato sauce. This dish should definitely not be missed out on if you want to have a taste of true Italian cuisine.</p>

                <!-- START OF SOCIAL CONVENTION -->
                <h2>Social Convention</h2>
                <h3>Greetings</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">When you’re introduced to an Italian, you should say ‘good day’ ( buongiorno) and shake hands (a single pump is enough). ‘Hello’ ( ciao) is used among close friends and young people, but it isn’t considered polite when addressing strangers unless they use it first. Women may find that some men kiss their hand, although this is rare nowadays.</p>
                <h3>Kissing</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Italian families and friends usually kiss when they meet, irrespective of their sex. If a lady expects you to kiss her, she offers her cheek. Between members of the opposite sex the ‘kiss’ is deposited high up on the cheek, never on the mouth (except between lovers!) and isn’t usually really a kiss, more a delicate brushing of the cheeks accompanied by kissing noises.</p>
                <h3>Invitations</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">If you’re invited to dinner by an Italian family (a rare honour), you should take along a small present of flowers, pastries or chocolates. Gifts of foreign food or drink aren’t generally well received unless they’re highly prized in Italy such as single malt whisky. Some people say you must never take wine, although this obviously depends on your hosts and how well you know them. If you do bring wine, it’s unlikely to be served with the meal, as the wine will have already been chosen.</p>
                <h3>Dress code</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Italians dress well and seem to have an inborn sense of elegance and style. Presentation and impression are all-important to Italians and are referred to as bella presenza or bella figura (literally ‘beautiful presentation or figure’). Italians generally dress well and appropriately, tending to be more formal in their attire than most northern Europeans and North Americans.</p>

                <!-- START OF LANGUAGES -->
                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">Italy is located in Western Europe, where it juts out into the Mediterranean Sea. It has a multicultural population of over 60 million inhabitants, who speak a diverse range of languages from minority languages to regional dialects. The official language spoken in Italy, however, is Italian. This language is spoken by around 85 million people throughout the world and serves as one of the working languages of the Council of Europe. It is considered a Romance language and is more closely related to Latin than any other Romance language. Italian has its roots in the Tuscan dialect of the Italo-Dalmatian subgroup, which belongs to the Indo-European language family. This dialect was used by the upper class and by writers of the Florentine society during the 1100’s. In fact, the famous author Dante Alighieri is often given credit for standardizing the language. Today, Italian is not listed by the constitution as the official language, although several courts have made legal decisions identifying the language as such.</p>
                <!-- END OF LANGUAGES -->

                <!-- START OF RELIGION -->
                <h2>Religions</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">The relationship between Italians and religion is very special, indeed.We have been a bunch of spiritual people since before the Romans. <br>Italy is, constitutionally, a nation embracing all creeds and religions, where the relationship between State and Church is regulated and sanctioned by constitutional laws. This is especially important as, geographically, the heart of the Catholic Church is within Italian soil. This very presence is rooted in the historical relevance of Rome in the history of Christianity, a relevance that has made the capital of Italy not only the geographical and beaurocratical centre of Catholicism, but also its spiritual core. <br>This is one of the reasons why we are, in the end and in spite of all, a Catholic country. No offense to all other religions welcomed and practiced within the boundaries of Italy, which are all embraced in a beautiful effort of inter-religious dialogue the Vatican itself has been working on with particular zeal, especially since the pontificate of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Each and every faith is welcome: some have been practiced along with Catholicism since the earliest times, like Judaism. Others have become preponderant in much more recent years, as a result of immigration, like Islam.</p>

                <!-- START OF TRADITIONAL ARTS-->
                <h2>Traditional Arts</h2>
                <h3>Tarantella</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Tarantella is a type of dance typical of the Southern regions of the country. It was originally associated to the phenomenon of tarantism, a form of hysteric behavior that caused paroxisms and seizures similar to those of a grand mal attack. People believed that it was the bite of a large spider, the tarantula, to cause it. The dance was created to mimic the seizures and movements of the sufferers (called tarantolati), who were believed to manage to free themselves of the venom by dancing.</p>

                <h3>Pizzica</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Pizzica is a traditional dance born in Apulia. It is strictly linked to the collective participation to the phenomenon of tarantismo. After being biten by the tarantula (essere pizzicati) the person lived a moment of choc and music was the only system to come out of it: musicians played for that person, who danced until the effect of poison was destroyed. Very often, this taumaturgic dance became a village affair, and everybody danced with the pizzicato. In other words, dancing the pizzica was a moment of freedom and abandonment, viewed by many with a positive sense of liberation. </p>

                <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">The “Gioconda” or Mona Lisa, probably the most famous portrait in the world, was painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1514 and is on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris. According to tradition, as well as the famous 16th century art historiographer and critic, GiorgioVasari, the woman depicted is Lisa Gherardini, i.e. “Mona” Lisa (short for “Madonna” , “Signora”), the wife of the noble Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo (thus the term “Gioconda” is also used).</p>
