        <h1>Culture of Russia</h1>
    
        <p>Nowadays, Russian cultural heritage is ranked seventh in the Nation Brands Index, based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from Western countries and the Far East. Due to the relatively late involvement of Russia in modern globalization and international tourism, many aspects of Russian culture, like Russian jokes and Russian art, remain largely unknown to foreigners.</p>
    
        <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    
        <p>Russian cuisine is a collection of the different cooking traditions of the Russian people. The cuisine is diverse, with Northern and Eastern European, Caucasian, Central Asian, Siberian, and East Asian influences. Russian cuisine derives its varied character from the vast and multi-ethnic expanse of Russia. There are top Russian foods that you have to try:</p>
    
        <h3>Borsch / Borscht (Originates from the Ukraine but will also be found in Russia)</h3>
    
        <p>This beet and cabbage red soup is a delicious belly warmer on Moscow's colder days, served with or without meat, potato, herbs (usually dill) and a dollop of smetana, Russian sour cream. Accompanied with a piece of rye bread or garlic bread topped with melted cheese, this dish is hearty enough to serve as a meal, although it is usually eaten as a starter. A staple of Russian cuisine, it would be an offense to leave Moscow without trying this soup at least once although its surprisingly tasty flavour will certainly leave you wishing you had tried more local variations. Other common Russian soups to try are ukha, a seasoned fish and vegetable broth, and schi, a cabbage-based broth.</p>

        </figure>
    
        <h3>Russian Pancakes</h3>
    
        <p>Blini are Russia's version of the thin French crepe and a staple on most Moscovian menus, typically made with buckwheat for savoury fillings or white flour for sweet toppings. You'll see accompaniments of smoked salmon, creamy mushrooms, sour cream, jams and condensed milk to name a few but the high-end, revered combination is a spoonful of red salmon or black sturgeon caviar. Another tasty Russian pancake is the cottage cheese version called syrniki, a denser form of ricotta-pancakes, which are eaten for breakfast or dessert. They're best served with homemade jams made from Russia's large array of berries, although condensed milk, honey and sour cream are also served as condiments.</p>

        <h3>Smoked Salmon or Salted Herring</h3>
    
        <p>Smoked, salted and marinated river and saltwater fish feature widely in Russian cuisine, and are expertly prepared to have a delicate and fresh flavour. On menus you'll typically find marinated or smoked salmon served alone as a dish or with pancakes, and salted herring served in salads, a typical one colloquially named â€˜herring under a fur coat' or shuba, which covers salted herring with layers of grated boiled vegetables, beets, onions and mayonnaise. Tartareis is also commonly found on menus in Moscow. Other common fish served in Moscow include trout, carp, zander, sturgeon and sterlet, also know as the Tsar fish.</p>

        <h3>Honeycake</h3>
    
        <p>The intricate-looking cake medovik involves alternating ultra-thin layers of honey spongecake with sweetened (sour) cream. The thin layers are built-up to form the cake, from anywhere between 5 and 15 layers, topped off with a sprinkling of crushed sponge or nuts and left overnight to soften and absorb the cream. Fluffy and light to eat, but full-on in flavour and sweetness.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Russian Dumplings</h3>
    
        <p>What's different about Russian dumplings (pelmeni) are the tasty herbs added to the packed meat fillings of lamb, pork or beef and the thinness of the dough. You can also find fish (typically salmon) or creamy mushrooms as common fillers. When ordering them, you'll be asked if you want to eat them solo (boiled) or served in a broth.</p>

        <h2>Social conventions</h2>
    
        <p id="social_convention">There are several things tourists should never do while visiting Russia. What are they? Let's check them out!</p>
    
        <h3>Do Not Leave Empty Bottles on The Table</h3>
    
        <p>In Russia, it is believed that leaving an empty bottle on the table brings you bad luck, specifically, that you are going to become poor. Many people across Russia say that this superstition arrived with the Cossacks in the 19th century, however it is still a heavy debate. For superstition's sake, do not do it.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption id="empty_bottles">Putting Empty Bottles on the Table</figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <h3>Do Not Smile All The Time</h3>
    
        <p>In Russia smiles are reserved for family members, friends and colleagues at work. It's just a typical Russian thing, and it's recommended you don't smile randomly at strangers while riding on public transport or going shopping. Russians have a saying "to smile without a reason is a sign of a fool".</p>

        </figure>
    
        <h3>Do Not Sit by The Corner of The Table</h3>
    
        <p>This is another Russian superstition that people still believe, especially when it concerns a young single lady. You'll notice that in every single restaurant or bar, if there's a large gathering, girls are usually in a rush to sit somewhere in the middle. Russians believe that someone who always chooses a seat at the corner of the table might never marry or be romantically involved with someone.</p>
    
        <h3>Do Not Shake Hands with Gloves on</h3>
    
        <p>You might think that it's a cold country and that's totally fine, but shaking hands with gloves on is considered to be extremely impolite. Be ready to take your gloves off if you're about to be introduced to someone.</p>
    
        <h3>Always Take Part in Toasts</h3>
    
        <p>A toast is a very important ritual, especially if it's during a birthday meal. If you're invited, you're expected to participate. In Russian culture it's an important gesture indicating friendship and appreciation</p>
    
    
        <h2>Language</h2>
    
        <p>Russia's 160 ethnic groups speak some 100 languages. According to the 2002 census, 142.6 million people speak Russian, followed by Tatar with 5.3 million and Ukrainian with 1.8 million speakers. Russian is the only official state language, but the Constitution gives the individual republics the right to make their native language co-official next to Russian. Russian is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the most widely spoken Slavic language. Russian belongs to the Indo-European language family and is one of the living members of the East Slavic languages; the others being Belarusian and Ukrainian (and possibly Rusyn). Written examples of Old East Slavic (Old Russian) are attested from the 10th century onwards.</p>
    
        <h2>Religion</h2>
    
        <p>Religion in Russia is very diversified. A 1997 law on religion recognises the right to freedom of conscience and creed to all the citizenry, the spiritual contribution of Orthodox Christianity to the history of Russia, and respect to "Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions and creeds which constitute an inseparable part of the historical heritage of Russia's peoples", including ethnic religions or Paganism, either preserved or revived. According to statistic, most of them are Russian Orthodox.(41%)</p>
    
        <h2>Traditional Arts</h2>
    
        <h3>Russian Folk Dance</h3>
    
        <p>Russian folk dance was and still is an important part of Russian culture. Traditional Russian folk dance has its origins in various groups, including those with Slavonian and Tatar origins. Some of the first Russian folk music and dance appeared around the 10th century when the Slavic tribes moved into Russia. As well, Russia witnessed various invasions from other countries. In turn, a cultural mix of music and dance helped develop Russian folk dances. Many of these early dances were performed and practiced by the lower classes. Typically the upper classes would watch performers rather than participate in the dances themselves.</p>
        <p>Russian folk dance traditions continue to play an important part in the culture of Russia's many ethnic groups. One example can be seen in the Ballets Russes, which invokes Russian folk dances and music in its pieces.</p>
    
        <h3>Traditional Instruments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Balalaika, a three-stringed, triangular sound-board, played with the fingers. It comes in many different sizes, prima being the most common. Two of the strings are tuned alike in descant, prima, secunda, and alto balalaikas.</li>
            <li>Gudok (also hudok), a three-stringed, pear-shaped Russian bowed instrument tuned in fifths which is usually held vertically.</li>
            <li>Gusli, one of the oldest known Eastern Slav musical instruments, described by the Greeks as early as the 6th century AD. Many different varieties of this plucked string instrument exist.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Handicraft</h3>
    
        <p>Matryoshka doll is a Russian nesting doll. A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.</p>
        <p>Other forms of Russian handicraft include khokhloma, Dymkovo toy, gzhel, Zhostovo painting, Filimonov toys, pisanka and palekh.</p>

        <h3>Icon Painting</h3>
    
        <p id="icon_painting">Russian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the krasny ugol, the "red" or "beautiful" corner. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the Tretyakov Gallery.</p>
