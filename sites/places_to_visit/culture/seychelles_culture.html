        <h1>Culture of Seychelles</h1>
    
        <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    
        <p>Blending Asian flavours from China and India with the European palette of Britain and France, Seychellois food is also rooted in the African continent, meaning everyone can find something to enjoy. Being surrounded by sea of course makes the local cuisine based to a large extent on seafood, and since the tropical islands abound with coconut trees, coconut milk is often combined with spices like ginger and garlic.</p>
    
        <h3>Shark Chutney(Satini Reken)</h3>
    
        <p>This one has a distinctive sour taste. It's boiled shark mashed and mixed with local lime juice or the bilimbi as it is commonly known with onions, pepper and other spices.</p>
    
        <h3>Grilled fish  (pwason griye) - red snapper (bourzwa) of the rabbit fish</h3>
    
        <p>If you have fresh catch, all the better, if not you can use other fresh fish. The local favourite is the red snapper (bourzwa) and the rabbit fish (kordonnyen) cooked with chillies either in a hot oven or on open fire. It's another must-have at celebration events. Careful though, it can be quite hot and spicy.</p>
    
        <h3>Octopus curry in coconut milk (kari koko zourit)</h3>
    
        <p>This is a dish that is included in every island celebration. Boiled and diced octopus (zourit) cooked in coconut milk and curry powder with a whole lot of added spices like garlic, ginger and eggplant. Every family has its own style of cooking it.</p>
    
        <h3>Traditional Seychelles Snacks</h3>
    
        <p>Three of the more popular snacks can be found in Seychelles are banana chips, breadfruit chips and “molouk”. The former are deep-fried and salted snacks, much like potato chips (crisps if you're British). The latter is basically deep fried bread dough.</p>
    
        <h2>Social conventions</h2>
    
        <p>The people live a simple and unsophisticated island life and tourism is carefully controlled to protect the unspoilt charm of the islands. Before the international airport opened in 1971, the islands could be reached only by sea, and since they are miles from anywhere, visitors were few and far between and the people were little influenced by the outside world. They developed their own language and culture which - like so many things on the islands - are unique.</p>
        <p>Shaking hand is the customary form of greeting. The Seychellois are very hospitable and welcome guests into their homes. When visiting someone's home, a gift is acceptable. For example, petrol is dispensed in litres, whilst bars sell bottled and draught beer in half-pint measures. Casual wear is esential and formal clothes are only worn by churchgoers. Swimwear should only br worn on the beaches.</p>
    
        <h2>Language</h2>
    
        <p>Seychellois have three official languages: Creole, English, and French. Creole developed from the French dialects of the original settlers. Its vocabulary is mostly French, with a few Malagasy, Bantu, English, and Hindi words.</p>
        <p>Most Seychellois can speak and understand French. Most younger Seychellois read English, the language of government and commerce. French is the language of the Roman Catholic Church in the Seychelles Islands.</p>
        <p>The following is a Seychellois proverb in the Creole language: Sak vid pa kapab debout (meaning "One doesn't work on an empty stomach"). Its literal translation is "an empty bag will not stand up on its own."</p>
    
        <h2>Religion</h2>
    
        <p>Almost all the inhabitants of Seychelles are Christian. More than 90 percent are Roman Catholic. Sunday masses are well attended. Religious holidays are celebrated as religious and social events.</p>
        <p>Like other Africans, many Seychellois Christians still follow tradional religious practices. These may include magic, witchcraft, and sorcery. It is common to consult a local fortune-teller known as a bonhomme de bois or a bonne femme de bois. Charms known as gris-gris are used to harm one's enemies.</p>
    
        <h2>Traditional Arts</h2>
    
        <h3>Sega</h3>
        
        <p>One of the most influential of the musical styles to emerge was sega. Sega originated among the slave population of Mauritius and Reunion before spreading to the Seychelles and the other islands of the Indian Ocean. In its most authentic form, sega is performed exclusively with simple instruments such as rattles, hand drums, gourds and musical bows. It is used as accompaniment for a form of traditional dance in which the feet stay firmly rooted to the floor while the rest of the body moves. Sega usually had lyrics about the oppression and longing for freedom felt by the slaves who composed it.</p>
        
        <h3>Moutya</h3>
        
        <p>Another style of music still enjoying considerable popularity is moutya or montea. It is musically similar to sega, but the dance it accompanies has more suggestive movements and the dancers freely move about the floor. Traditionally, the dance takes place around a campfire and starts slowly to the beat of a single drum, then gets faster and more suggestive as the tempo increases. The drum is made of goatskin and is tuned by heating it by the campfire, a process that must be repeated periodically. Female moutya dancers often wear brightly colored dresses with festive, flowered patterns to enhance the visual aspect of the performance</p>
    
        <h3>Maloya</h3>
        
        <p id="maloya">A related style is called maloya. This is a slower, more reflective style of music than sega, though their instrumentation is similar. The lyrics are often sung in a shout-and-response style and have historically had a rebellious, political tone. This connotation has continued to the present, and Maloya was banned until the 1960s because of its connection to Creole separatism. Performances by certain maloya artists with strong political leanings continued to be banned until the 1980s.</p>
