                <h3>İmam Bayıldı</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">This stuffed aubergine entree is delicious, hearty, and versatile. Aubergines can be filled with rice, bulgur, mince, and/or other veg and smothered in oil and butter before being baked or cooked on the stovetop.</p>
                <h3>Döner</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Döner is a typical slow cooked meat sandwich, made with chicken, lamb, or beef and served with vegetables, spices, and garlic yogurt. Döner is usually available from takeaways, but don't be fooled, it's exponentially tastier than McDonalds.</p>

                <h2>Social Convention</h2>
                <h3>Dress</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">As a Muslim country, women should keep their knees and their shoulders covered. When entering a mosque, you must remove your shoes, and you must have yourself well covered. Make sure to heed any instructions, as sometimes women cannot go into certain mosques at certain times of the day. Also, and this is from personal experience, wearing red nail polish in more conservative Ankara for example, brought unwanted attention to me as I wore flip flops up to the shop to buy some water. Do avoid visiting a mosque on a Friday since it is a day of prayer.<br/>
                1. When meeting shake hands firmly. When departing it is not always customary to shake hands although it is practised occasionally.<br/>
                2. Friends and relations would greet each other with either one or two kisses on the cheek. Elders are always respected by kissing their right hand then placing the forehead onto the hand.<br/>
                3. When entering a room, if you are not automatically met by someone greet the most elderly or most senior first. At social occasions greet the person closest to you then work your way around the room or table anti-clockwise.<br/>
                4. Etc.</p>
                <h3>Dining Etiquette</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">1. Most business entertaining will take place in restaurants. Turks enjoy food and the meal is a time for relaxing and engaging in some good conversation.<br/>
                2. Evening meals may be accompanied by some alcohol, usually the local tipple called Raký (pronounced rak-uh). It will comprise of a few courses with the main course always meat or fish based, accompanied by bread and a salad.<br/>
                3. Turks smoke during meals and will often take breaks between courses to have a cigarette and a few drinks before moving onto the next.<br/>
                4. Etc.</p>

                <!-- START OF LANGUAGES -->
                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">The official language, Turkish, is the first language spoken by 90% of the 63m population. Minority languages include Kurdish, spoken by 6% of the population. Arabic is spoken by 1.2% of the Turkish population; most of those speakers are bilingual Arabic and Turkish speakers. Other minority languages include Circassian, spoken by more than 0.09% throughout the country, Greek, Armenian and Judezmo, a Romance language spoken by Jews.</p>
                <!-- END OF LANGUAGES -->

                <!-- START OF RELIGION -->
                <h2>Religions</h2>
                <p class="culture_description">Religious Beliefs. Islamic tradition, ideology, and ritual are very important. About 98 percent of Turkey's citizens are nominally Muslims, of whom about 80 to 85 percent are Sunnis of the Hanafi school and 15 to 20 percent are members of Shiite sects (mostly Alevi). Turkish Muslims recognize the standard Islamic creed and duties, but only the most religious fast or make a pilgrimage to Mecca. Four percent of Turks identify themselves as atheists, and 4 percent as agnostics. For most Turks, Islam plays an important role in rites of passage: naming shortly after birth, circumcision for boys, marriage, and funerals. The state controls religious education and most religious personnel by supervising the schools that train Sunni imams and certifying imams as state employees who work in community mosques.</p>

                <!-- START OF TRADITIONAL ARTS-->
                <h2>Traditional Arts</h2>
                <h3>Turkish Calligraphy (Husn-i Hat)</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Turkish calligraphy is a unique artistic creation although calligraphy itself is not of Turkish origin. Ottomans adopted it with religious fervor and inspiration, taking this art to its pinacle over a five hundred year period. The literal meaning of the Turkish word for calligraphy (hat) is line or way. In essence, Husn-i Hat comprises the beautiful lines inscribed with reed pens on paper using ink made from soot. In the 13th century, Yakut-ul-Mustasimi,a calligraphist from Amasya, made a breakthrough in calligraphy by using nibs of various widths and sizes in one composition. Later calligraphists followed and developed his methods. Later, Sheyh Hamdullah, a famous calligraphist from the period of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, introduced major changes in the traditional seven writing styles and put the mark of the Turkish national character on Islamic writing.</p>

                <h3>Saz (Turkish Long Neck Lute)</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">The Saz is the grandfather of the Greek Bouzouki. It's originated in Central Asia where Turks lived before their westward migration. Like the guitar in Spain and the bouzouki in Greece, the Saz is the most popular stringed instrument in Turkey. Although similar in shape to the Greek Bouzouki, the construction, size and sound of the Saz is different. You need a baglama saz to be able to play the microtones (Perde) of Arabic music. These instruments have traditional tied frets that are movable, and 3 courses of strings.</p>

                <h3>Tar</h3>
                <p class="culture_description">Tar is a Turkish folk instrument played with a plectrum (tezene). It is widely used in the Kars region. It is also a commonly used instrument in Azerbaijan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Georgia. Its body is composed of two bowls of different size and is generally made from mulberry trees. The gögüs section is covered with a membrane taken from the heart of water buffaloes or cattle. Sap section is from hard wood and fish line pitches are tied onto it. There are two main groups of strings on tar. Those in the first group are used in playing the tune and consists of three groups of two strings. The other group of strings are called Kök and Zengi and are tuned according to the mode to be used and enhance the tone.</p>
