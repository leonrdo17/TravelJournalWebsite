                <h2>Paris</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Paris is a wondrous city for adults and kids alike. They don’t call it the City of Lights for just any reason. Its beauty is etched in its pores and is lit up from within its core– from its culture and architecture to its history and food. How can you create the perfect Paris vacation for the whole family? By choosing activities and landmarks accessible to all ages so no one is disappointed. Paris exudes culture and its offerings are endless. For an ultimate dose of culture wit the kids, venture to Montmartre and walk up the steps to the Basilica of the Sacré Coeur. It’s the highest point in the city and the view of Paris is amazing. Then stop in the local market to get your children’s portraits done. Meanwhile on the Left Bank, the Musée Rodin is one of the city’s great museums showcasing the artist’s famous sculptures and gardens. Paris is home to some of the most famous art in the world, and it’s the perfect place to educate your kids on art history. Head to the Musée d’Orsay which was installed in a former railway station, built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. The museum displays collections of art from the period 1848 to 1914. The art is phenomenal and kids will really enjoy seeing delightful pieces by Monet, Degas, and Renoir. And of course there’s the Louvre, one of the world’s most famous museums, that showcases works such as the Mona Lisa and many other masterpieces. http://www.minitime.com/trip-tips/10-Wonderful-Reasons-to-Visit-Paris-with-Kids-article</p>

                <h2>Amiens</h2>
                <p class="city_description">On the banks of the Somme River in the heart of the Picardy region, the charming town of Amiens is full of surprises. Surrounded by quiet countryside, Amiens has an unexpected energy-especially in the trendy Quartier Saint-Leu. Many of the city's top attractions spark the imagination. Watch a stunning light show that illuminates the cathedral in a rainbow of colors. Admire one of the first skyscrapers in Europe, the Tour Perret, which has a light show of its own to mark the evening hours. Delve into the creative world of Jules Verne at his house, which displays his models of flying machines and naval ships. Wander cobblestone streets in the old town, relax at a café terrace and enjoy a gourmet meal by the harbor. There are also interesting sights nearby, such as the WWI Battlefields of Somme and the Samara Amusement Park that reenacts scenes from prehistoric times. A masterpiece of Gothic architecture, this UNESCO-listed cathedral is the largest church in France based on its total surface area of 7,700 square meters. With a length of 145 meters, the cathedral could fit a football field. The immense size and intricate details are remarkable. Built between 1220 to 1288, the cathedral was considered so impressive that it inspired the plan for a similar one in Cologne, Germany. The facade features three doorways influenced by Notre-Dame in Paris. The doorways are decorated with a profusion of statues: Old and New Testament figures, apostles, prophets, and a figure of Christ in the attitude of blessing.</p>

                <h2>Arles</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Arles is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site! Evidence of the importance of this area during Roman times is found throughout the town and not isolated in one small setting. Rather than a few remnants of crumbling ruins, there are impressive sites that have been extensively restored and play a vital role in the life of the community today. In particular, the 2000-year-old amphitheater, Les Arènes, continues to be used for colorful festivals (férias) featuring the Camargue bulls, horses and costumed locals as well as for concerts and bullfights. Arles is referred to as the Gateway to the Camargue, a unique landscape situated to the south on the Rhône delta. Famous for its flamingos, salt flats, semi-wild white horses, black bulls and French cowboys called gardiens, the area is often called the wild west of France. Visit a traditional manade (ranch) to be fascinated by the interaction between the horses and bulls, guided by the skilled riding of the gardiens. In the UNESCO-designated Pont du Gau ornithological park, thousands of birds flourish in the wetlands, including up to 40,000 flamingos when they return each year to breed in the mudflats. This truly is a sight to see. The Camargue is not so much beautiful, as it is unique. Marshy and scrubby to a certain extent, with large inland salt lakes. Rice has been a crop there since the Middle Ages and the Camargue red rice is popular. World-famous fleur de sel is harvested in the colorful salt flats over which the sun sets in spectacular performances. The famous dune-filled beaches along the Mediterranean stretch as far as the eye can see.</p>

                <h2>Avignon</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Set at the heart of Avignon’s old town, the 14th-century Palais des Papes was built to house the Catholic Church when Pope Clement V relocated here to escape the chaos which was erupting in Rome. This mighty, 700-year-old structure is considered one of the most important Gothic buildings in Europe, and together with the ramparts and the Petit Palais museum, forms part of a stunning architectural ensemble. A visit to the palace - which was once home to 9 popes - enables you to view the ornately frescoed papal apartments, along with their places of worship and impressive stone halls. Avignon’s famous bridge is immortalised in song thanks to the famous children’s nursery rhyme. Completed in 1185, the Pont Saint-Bénezet, as it is officially known, was said to be named after a local pastor who had saintly visions urging him to construct a bridge across the Rhône. The bridge measured 900 metres long with 20 arches and linked Avignon with neighbouring Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. Today, the bridge no longer spans the whole of the Rhône as all but four of its spans were washed away in the 17th century following centuries of ongoing construction work. Venture out across the remains of the bridge and you’ll be rewarded with breathtaking views over Avignon’s old town and beyond. At the bottom of Avignon’s old town lies the River Rhône, which offers splendid views over the city from the boat deck. Thanks to repairs to the riverbed, it’s now really easy to access the water and embark on a memorable fluvial cruise. Options range from the traditional food and wine itineraries to more contemporary choices which even include a live DJ cruise.</p>
