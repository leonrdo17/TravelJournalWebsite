                <h1>Selamat Datang Di Malaysia.<br>(Welcome to Malaysia)</h1>
                <h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
                <p class="city_description">The Capital city of Malaysia abounds with architectural marvels, pre-war buildings. Petronas Twin Towers is a world-renowned icon of Malaysia, the centre piece of KL city centre which consists of a shopping mall, start-rated hotels, landscaped park and a convention centre.

                <h2>Pahang</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Pahang is the largest state on Peninsular Malaysia and home to a variety of environments from the montane forests of the Titiwangsa Range to lush rainforests, plus beaches and islands. Malaysia’s largest national park, Taman Negara is situated on the state’s northern border with Terengganu and Kelantan and the South China Sea fronts Pahang’s coastline and it’s here tourists that can experience Malaysia’s cultural heartland. Many travellers visit Malaysia specifically for its warm weather and year-round sunshine. While this is a bonus for most, the heat and humidity can take its toll over time, and this certainly adds to the appeal of Malaysia’s cooler mountains. In the days before air conditioning, the only respite from the heat and humidity was to visit mountainous hill stations where the altitude moderated the climate.</p>

                <h2>Penang</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Penang has become well known for its street art popping up all over historic Georgetown. Running around the city and finding all of the pieces is a lot of fun, but can be tiring in the Penang heat! I suggest pinning all the locations onto your Google map so you can work out the quickest way to get around them all, be prepared for some lines, but you may also get lucky and find you have one all to yourself. Head up to Habitat on Penang Hill to see Penang from the highest vantage point in the city. Habitat is currently building a trail of sky bridges which will be ready for visitors from March 2017. Whilst there you can take a guided tour through the nature trail to learn about the rainforest, swing on the giant swings over and even sight some tarantulas!.</p>

                <h2>Negeri Sembilan</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Negeri Sembilan is one of the smallest states in Malaysia and it is not particularly well known as a tourist area. However there is a lot for the visitor to see and it is well worth taking time to look around. Being located close to the Klang Valley, it means that many of the top Negeri Sembilan attractions can be easily reached on a day trip from Kuala Lumpur. The name Negeri Sembilan means 'Land of the Nine States' after the nine districts, each with their own chieftain, which used to make up the state. Borders have shifted over the centuries and districts re-organised so that today there are seven districts in Negeri Sembilan, namely Seremban (formerly Sungai Ujong), Port Dickson, Rembau, Jelebu, Kuala Pilah, Jempol and Tampin.The state is home to Malaysia's Minangkabau culture, a community originally from West Sumatra who settled here in the 15th Century. The Minangkabau are famous for their unique and elegant architecture with curving, ornate rooflines whose points are said to resemble buffalo horns. Their society is traditionally matrilineal, meaning that wealth and surnames pass down the female line, although this community, numbering around 300,000, is nowadays fully integrated with the rest of the Malay population. The ruler of Negeri Sembilan is known as the Yang di Pertuan Besar (He Who Is Greatest) instead of Sultan as in other Malaysian states.</p>

                <h2>Malacca</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Malacca is a hotchpotch of Malay, Chinese, Indian, European and sundry influences. Malaysians laud Malacca’s laidback atmosphere and lost-in-time feel; stores close early here, traffic goes by at leisurely pace and city life is a languid affair. Between the scattered historic spots are atmospheric Chinese shop fronts and traditional Malay kampongs. Though the state may not boast a white-sand shoreline reminiscent of its East Coast cousins, Malacca is noteworthy for its heritage hotspots. When the sun goes down, one of the city’s most popular destinations is the Friday and Saturday Jonker Walk Night Market which plays host to a collection of stalls that sell everything but the kitchen sink. Here you can purchase a variety of trinkets and even sample some of the state’s best-known local fare including fried egg ice cream and fried radish cake. At night the handful of bars along the boulevard become a mini street party with tables oozing beyond the sidewalks and a mix of live music beating throughout the area.</p>
