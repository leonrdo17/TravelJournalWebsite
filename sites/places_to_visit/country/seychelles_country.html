                <h2>Sunset Beach</h2>
                <p class="city_description">The scenery that greets you at Sunset Beach is typical of the Seychelles: golden sand, clear, inviting water, and impressive palm trees are all present here, making for a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon in the sun or in the shade. The shallow water also lends itself particularly well to swimming or snorkelling, while it is also possible to go scuba diving or kayaking here. Finally, there is an old coral formation on the beach, which, combined with the surrounding landscape, make this beach a great prospect for photographs too. All in all, Sunset Beach is an excellent little beach on Mahé which possesses a number of different features that will appeal to all kinds of holidaymaker. While most visitors to this bay will probably be guests of the nearby hotel, there is no reason that guests cannot come from further afield to enjoy this beautiful beach.</p>

                <h2>Anse Lazio</h2>
                <p class="city_description">Anse Lazio has often been described as the most beautiful beach in the world thanks to its perfect mixture of pristine golden sand, crystal-clear water, and impressive granite formations. This reputation means it is busier than many Seychelles beaches, so anyone looking to avoid other tourists should arrive early (before 09.00) to beat the crowds. For many people, the first time they see Anse Lazio, the moment takes their breath away. The perfect combination of sun, sea, and sand make it an incredible beach by anyone’s definition. There is a designated swimming area surrounded by a net which keeps fish and other creatures from disturbing swimmers, and there is often a lifeguard on-duty, ensuring visitors can feel safe while they’re in the water. The beach is also excellent for snorkelling, with great visibility in the crystal-clear water, and is equally well-suited to families thanks to the large, sandy areas where children can play. However, the water does get deep quickly, so children and unconfident swimmers should stay in the designated area and try not to stray too far from the shore.</p>

                <h2>Aldabra Atoll</h2>
                <p class="city_description">One of the world’s largest atoll and listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, Aldabra Atoll is the place to see giant land tortoises (Around 150,000 tortoises in all). The atoll consists of 13 islands making up about one-third of the Seychelles’ land mass. The atoll’s islands nurture a vast array of both unique flora and fauna as well as the world’s largest population of giant tortoises. For those divers and snorkelers, its lagoon will definitely conquer you since it boasts the most vibrant marine life of the entire archipelago.</p>
